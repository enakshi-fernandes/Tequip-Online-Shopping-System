# Tequip-Online-Shopping-System
Hi there!
Created an Online Shopping System that implements various concepts of OOPs in C++ and file handling.
This was worked upon as part of a OOPs project incorporating some concepts of software engineering as well.
Documentation about this project is included in the SRS along with various UML diagrams which pictorially represent how the system works.
